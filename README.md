apex-trigger-template
=====================
Iâ€™ve developed this trigger template because among all the templates that have already been published by experienced salesforce professionals, some offer things that others don't. The main idea was to unify all the cool stuff in one single template and, if possible, improve it :)

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
	<li>It uses Builder pattern.</li>
	<li>It forces to write one single trigger per SObject.</li>
	<li>It forces to write the logic in separated units.</li>
	<li>Choose between executing a logic unit always or just once.</li>
	<li>Execute the same logic unit in different events just by adding the proper interfaces.</li>
	<li>Zero risk when accessing the SObjects (old/new collections).</li>
	<li>The trigger has only one line of code :)</li>
</ul>

Be Apex my friend!
